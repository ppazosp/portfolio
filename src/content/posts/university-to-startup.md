## From Hackathon to Reality

It started like every university tech story - five friends, too much caffeine, and the delusion that we could build something better than existing solutions.

**The difference? We actually did it.**

## What We Learned

Building a startup with university friends isn't the fairy tale you see on social media. Here's the reality:

### The Good
- **Shared vision** - We all understood the problem we were solving
- **Complementary skills** - Everyone brought something different to the table  
- **Low overhead** - No fancy office, no expensive salaries, just pure execution
- **Trust** - Years of friendship meant we could be brutally honest about bad ideas

### The Hard Parts
- **Money talks** - Equity discussions test friendships like nothing else
- **Role clarity** - "We're all co-founders" works until someone needs to make final decisions
- **Growth pressure** - Scaling from 5 to 15 people revealed leadership gaps
- **Personal sacrifice** - Watching friends choose stability while we chose uncertainty

## The Reality Check

Six months in, we learned the hardest lesson: 
**Good friends don't automatically make good business partners.**

But when they do? When the friendship survives the stress, the disagreements, and the 3am crisis calls? That's when you build something truly special.

*We're still here. Still building. Still friends.*
