title: "Nessie – AI-Powered Document Intelligence"
role: "Software Architect & AI Engineer"
problem: "Enterprises struggled with retrieving knowledge from large volumes of unstructured documents. Existing tools were slow, lacked context, and failed to integrate AI effectively into daily workflows."
approach: "As project architect and AI engineer, I designed and led the development of Nessie, a multi-agent RAG system. I built the core architecture, orchestrated the AI agents, and integrated advanced search (semantic, keyword, hybrid) with a secure lakehouse."
outcome: "Delivered a scalable AI system that enables teams to retrieve insights instantly, generate contextual answers with citations, and automate document workflows. Positioned Nessie as OSIX Tech’s flagship B2B product with active pilots in industrial and legal sectors."
stack: ["Python", "FastAPI", "Langchain", "Supabase (Postgres + pgvector)", "Unstructured", "Docker", "Playwright", "Custom Multi-Agent Orchestration"]
