title: "ML Infrastructure Platform"
role: "Platform Architect"
problem: "Data science team spending 80% of time on infrastructure instead of model development, with inconsistent deployment processes and no model versioning."
approach: "Built end-to-end MLOps platform with automated pipelines, model registry, A/B testing framework, and real-time monitoring capabilities."
outcome: "Reduced model deployment time from 3 weeks to 15 minutes, increased data scientist productivity by 65%, and enabled serving 200M+ daily inferences."

## Platform Architecture

The ML platform was designed to abstract away infrastructure complexity while providing powerful tools for model lifecycle management. The solution enabled data scientists to focus on model development rather than operational concerns.

### Key Features

- **Automated Pipelines**: Git-triggered model training and deployment workflows
- **Model Registry**: Centralized model versioning with metadata and lineage tracking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Model performance and drift detection in production
- **Resource Management**: Auto-scaling compute resources based on training demand
