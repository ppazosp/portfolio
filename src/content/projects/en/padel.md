title: "Padel Court Reservation System"
role: "Full-Stack Developer"
problem: "The residential community where I worked relied on a paper-based booking system for padel courts, which was inefficient, error-prone, and hard to manage."
approach: "On my own initiative, I designed and built a custom mobile app to digitalize the reservation process. The system allowed staff to manage court bookings in real time with an internal dashboard, without exposing access to customers or adding payment gateways."
outcome: "Successfully transformed a manual workflow into a digital solution, eliminating booking errors and improving staff efficiency. More importantly, it demonstrated my ability to identify a real-world problem and deliver an effective technical solution proactively."
