title: "Nessie – AI-Powered Document Intelligence"
role: "Software Architect & AI Engineer"
problem: "Enterprises struggle with retrieving knowledge from large volumes of unstructured documents. Existing tools are slow, lack context, and fail to integrate AI effectively into daily workflows."
approach: "As project architect and AI engineer, I am designing and leading the development of Nessie, an agentic RAG system. I am building the core architecture, orchestrating AI agents, and integrating advanced search (semantic, keyword, hybrid) with a secure lakehouse."
outcome: "Nessie is currently under development, with three companies already interested in pilot deployments. The system is designed to enable instant knowledge retrieval with contextual answers, citations, and automated document workflows — positioning it as OSIX Tech’s flagship B2B product."
