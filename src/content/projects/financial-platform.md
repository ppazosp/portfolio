title: "High-Frequency Trading Platform"
role: "Lead Architect"
problem: "Legacy trading system couldn't handle increasing market volatility and had latency issues causing significant revenue loss during peak trading hours."
approach: "Redesigned the core architecture using event sourcing and CQRS patterns, implemented microsecond-level optimizations, and deployed on bare-metal servers with custom kernel tuning."
outcome: "Reduced average trade execution latency from 45ms to 1.2ms and increased system throughput by 340%, enabling the firm to capture $2.3M additional revenue monthly."

## Technical Implementation

The high-frequency trading platform required fundamental architectural changes to meet the demanding performance requirements. The solution involved multiple layers of optimization from the application layer down to the hardware configuration.

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Event Sourcing**: All trading events are stored as immutable facts, enabling perfect audit trails and system state reconstruction
- **CQRS Implementation**: Separated read and write operations with specialized data stores for each
- **Memory Management**: Custom memory allocators to avoid garbage collection pauses
- **Network Optimization**: Direct packet processing using DPDK to bypass kernel networking stack
