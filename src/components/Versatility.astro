            As a software architect, I believe specialization is limiting.

            Technology is a tool, not an identity. The moment you define yourself by a specific language or framework, 
            you start making biased architectural decisions. A Python expert might force Python solutions where 
            JavaScript would be better, simply because that's their comfort zone.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-muted font-mono leading-[1.7]">
            Today, with AI as my amplifier, the gap between knowing a technology and being an expert has practically 
            disappeared. I can architect solutions in any language, leverage any framework, and implement using any 
            paradigm because AI handles the syntax while I focus on the system design.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-muted font-mono leading-[1.7]">
            What matters is understanding patterns, principles, and trade-offs. The rest is just implementation details 
            that AI can help with instantly. This approach lets me choose the right tool for each problem, 
            not the tool I'm most familiar with.
